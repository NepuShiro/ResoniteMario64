# ResoniteMario64

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to spawn in and control mario from Super Mario 64.

Made possible by [libsm64](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64).
I also used [CVRSuperMario64](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/CVRSuperMario64) as a reference for creating this.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Find `Super Mario 64 [US].z64` with hash `20b854b239203baf6c961b850a4a51a2` rename it to `baserom.us.z64` then place it into your `rml_libs` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_libs` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Place [ResoniteMario64.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/ResoniteMario64/releases/latest/download/ResoniteMario64.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
